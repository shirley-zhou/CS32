2.	First 12 (r,c) coordinates popped off the stack: (6,4), (6,3), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (8, 6), (8,7), (8,8), (7,8), (6,6), (5,4), (4,4)

4.	First 12 (r,c) coordinates popped off the queue: (6,4), (5,4), (6,5), (6,3), (4,4), (6,6), (7,5), (3,4), (4,5), (8,5), (2,4), (4,6)
	
	Starting from each coordinates, the algorithms both search 4 directions clockwise from north to determine possible open paths.
	Next, the stack algorithm will continue searching down the last discovered open direction, while the queue algorithm will continue searching starting from the first
	open path found. This is repeated for each coordinate visited. The difference comes from the fact that the stack will set the current coordinate as the last one found, 
	while the queue sets the current coordinate popped as the first one found.
